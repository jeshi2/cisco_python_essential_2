"""
It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

Your task is to write a program which:

    asks the user for some text;
    checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints the result.

Note:

    assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
    treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
    spaces are not taken into account during the check – treat them as non-existent;
    there are more than a few correct solutions – try to find more than one.

"""

text = input("Enter text: ")

# Remove all spaces...
text = text.replace(' ','')

# ... and check if the word is equal to reversed itself
if len(text) > 1 and text.upper() == text[::-1].upper():
	print("It's a palindrome")
else:
	print("It's not a palindrome")
