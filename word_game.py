"""
Let's play a game. We will give you two strings: one being a word (e.g., "dog") and the second being a combination of any characters.

Your task is to write a program which answers the following question: are the characters comprising the first string hidden inside the second string?

For example:

    if the second string is given as "vcxzxduybfdsobywuefgas", the answer is yes;
    if the second string is "vcxzxdcybfdstbywuefsas", the answer is no (as the letters "d", "o", or "g" don't appear in this order)

Hints:

    you should use the two-argument variants of the pos() functions inside your code;
    don't worry about case sensitivity.
